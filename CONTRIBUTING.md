# Contributing

Every contribution is very much appreciated and credited. 
Before you begin, please read carefully the following sections.

# Check your goals

It is important to understand that *pypz* is an extensible framework. Different
interfaces are provided to allow you to integrate your custom implementation
with *pypz*. These implementations shall be maintained separately from *pypz*'s
core. In other words, if you want to implement your own operator, plugin,
deployer or channels, you don't need to contribute to this project, but you
shall create your own repository for that. On the other hand, if you want
to improve *pypz*'s core functionality or the builtin assets (e.g., K8s
deployer or the Kafka IO port plugins), then you are at the right place.

If you think that your implementation should be part of the base package
then contact me.
